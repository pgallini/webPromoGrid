                options and rights available to you.​&nbsp;<br></p>
            <p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your Consent – please read carefully. &nbsp;<br>By downloading, installing, accessing and/or using the App you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy, including to the collection and
                processing of your Personal Information (as defined below). If you disagree to any term hereof, you may not download, install, access or use the App, and must promptly and permanently remove the App and any part thereof from your systems
                and devices, and cease any and all use thereof. &nbsp;Please note: you are not obligated by law to provide us with any Personal Information. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are providing us with Personal Information at your own
                free will, for the purposes described in Section 4 below, and that we may retain such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any applicable laws and regulations. &nbsp;<br></p>
            <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which information we may collect on our Users?<br>We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:Non-personal Information, which is non-identifying and non-identifiable information, without particular
                reference to the identity of the User from which such information was collected; and Personal Information, which is individually identifiable information that identifies an individual, or may with reasonable effort identify an individual,
                either alone or in combination with other information, or may be of private or sensitive nature. &nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, any Non-personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal
                Information as long as such connection or linkage exists. Personal and Non-personal Information which is being gathered in connection with the App may consist of the following:<br>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The User may also automatically
                provide us with certain technical Non-personal Information and aggregated usage information, such as the User's mobile device brand and model, operating system type and version, screen resolution, geo-location, which Third Party Services’
                applications are installed on the User’s device and User’s uses thereof through the App, the User's manual configurations, 'click-stream', interactions and activities on the App, the period of time the User used the App and related time
                stamps, crash and error logs, etc.<br>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To auto register with email, We ask for and get account permission at the time of install application. It helps you to notify that, is there an important bug fix or an
                app update.<br>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the User may voluntarily provide us with any other Non-personal and Personal Information, such as certain contact information provided by the User when contacting us (and any additional
                information related to such contacts), and/or other information related to actions performed by the User in connection with the App. We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval.<br></p>

                of the App, and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party app as detailed below. We may also collect Non-personal Information through the processing,
                analysis and anonymization of Personal Information provided by you. We collect Personal Information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, we collect Personal Information when you contact us directly or through use of certain features

                affiliates with anonymized data and other aggregated, statistical and/or inferred Non-personal Information; to enable us to provide our Users with a better user experience, with more relevant and accurate information, services, features
